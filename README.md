# cat-detector

Using OpenCV, classifies webcam images using a ResNet-50 network that has been pre-trained on ImageNet images. If a "tabby" is detected in the top three classification results, the program plays a "meow" sound. My cat doesn't like it but maybe yours will.

Requires OpenCV, simpleaudio, Tensorflow, and Keras.
